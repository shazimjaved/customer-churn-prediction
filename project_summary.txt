CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION PROJECT SUMMARY
==========================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
-----------------
This project implements a machine learning solution to predict customer churn using deep learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service based on their historical data and behavioral patterns.

DATASET INFORMATION:
--------------------
- Dataset: Churn_Modelling.csv
- Total Records: 10,000 customers
- Features: 14 columns including customer demographics, financial information, and account details
- Target Variable: Exited (binary: 1 = churned, 0 = retained)

KEY FEATURES ANALYZED:
----------------------
- Credit Score: Customer's creditworthiness
- Geography: Location (France, Spain, Germany)
- Demographics: Age, Gender
- Account Information: Tenure, Balance, Number of Products
- Services: Credit Card ownership, Active membership status
- Financial: Estimated Salary

METHODOLOGY:
------------
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
   - Removed unnecessary columns (RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname)
   - Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables
   - Standardized features using StandardScaler

2. Model Architecture
   - Neural Network with TensorFlow/Keras
   - Input Layer: 11 features
   - Hidden Layer: 11 neurons with sigmoid activation
   - Output Layer: 1 neuron with sigmoid activation
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy

3. Training Configuration
   - Train-Test Split: 80-20
   - Batch Size: 50
   - Epochs: 100
   - Validation Split: 20%

TECHNICAL STACK:
----------------
- Python 3.x
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
- NumPy (Numerical computing)
- Scikit-learn (ML utilities)
- TensorFlow/Keras (Deep learning)
- Matplotlib (Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (Interactive development)

RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE:
------------------------
- Model successfully trained on customer data
- Validation accuracy stabilized around 79-80%
- Training shows consistent improvement over epochs
- Binary classification effectively distinguishes churning customers

BUSINESS IMPACT:
----------------
- Helps identify at-risk customers before they churn
- Enables proactive retention strategies
- Reduces customer acquisition costs
- Improves customer lifetime value
- Supports data-driven decision making

FILES INCLUDED:
---------------
- customer-churn-prediction.ipynb: Main analysis notebook
- Churn_Modelling.csv: Customer dataset
- README.md: Comprehensive project documentation

NEXT STEPS AND IMPROVEMENTS:
----------------------------
- Implement additional ML algorithms for comparison
- Add feature importance analysis
- Create model deployment pipeline
- Implement real-time prediction API
- Add more sophisticated feature engineering
- Include cross-validation for better model evaluation
